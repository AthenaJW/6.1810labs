The first five two elements have read execute permissions, which lines up with the text section.
I think the next element (0x2000) is the data, since it has read write permission.
I think the next element (0x3000) is the guard page, since it doesn't seem to have valid permissions.
The next element (0x4000) should be a stack, since it has read write permission.

There is a lot of virtual addresses that don't map anywhere in the physical address space after this.
This is because this is the heap/unused, which doesn't get a physical address until there is space on the heap allocated.

The second to last one is the trapframe, because it has read write permission.
The last one is the trampoline, because it has read execute position.
